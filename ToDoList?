make app 

Leo has created a grea starting code to build upon, good job homie! 

While giving it a look I made some comments explaining what things do(understanding code and making it easier to navigate)
I also added some comments with future methods we should think about implementing. 

I'll list the things on the top of the to do list here

1. how to populate board?
  a. need another class that either contains arrays for game sets or imports game sets from an external txt file 
  b. controller should have a variable that stores the random game set as a two dim array
